Progress Efficiency

The method to measure the effectiveness of progress within the FastKISS
Methodology will be TimeFLIES: An application of the speed formula.

number_of_requirements / time_of_dead_line = minimum_ratio_per_unit_time. 
Progress must be periodically sampled and averaged. By comparing them with
the result above, it can be estimated whether the rate of progress will be
enough to meet the deadline.
